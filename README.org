* Goals
    This project was invented to help
    extracting audio files from powerpoint files
    (\*.pptx), to use seperately if needed

** TODO choose output file name

** TODO choose output path

** TODO use tk for mode visual interaction
    - [] progress bar

** TODO handle missing ffmpeg

** TODO use ffmpeg binding for python

** TODO write a blog post about this

* How it works
** Requirement
        - [x] It requires ffmpeg (or ffmpeg.exe, in windows) to be in your path
        - [x] python3

** How to run
        #+BEGIN_SRC shell
        python extract_audio.py # windows=
        python3 extract_audio.py # *nix=
        #+END_SRC
        It shows a file-dialog to select pptx files
        It is required for your files to be in *pptx* format
        Then it puts /MPEG-4 audio/ files in the same folder as
        powerpoint files.
